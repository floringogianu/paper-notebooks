# Paper Notebooks

Notebooks containing small toy problems aiding the understanding
of Machine-Learning papers and book sections I am interested in.
Generally these are small examples I reproduced from the papers 
I read in order to understand some of the interesting methods or
concepts involved.

Hopefully some of these notebooks will evolve in research ideas
or blog-posts, further developing these techniques.

List of paper notes:

1. A Meta-Transfer Objective for Learning to Disentangle Causal Mechanisms <[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10912), [notebooks](meta_learning_disentangle_causal/)>

2. Functional Variational Bayesian Neural Networks <[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05779), [notebooks](functional_bnns/)>

3. Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN <[paper](), [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/floringogianu/per-study/blob/master/notebooks/bootstrapping.ipynb)>

4. Gradient Estimation Using Stochastic Computation Graphs <[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05254), notebooks>


## Requirements

I plan using mostly [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and web-based
vizualisation libraries such as [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and
[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).

The environment in the root of this repo is currently sufficient to run all the notebooks. Specific
environments and requirements could be later added in each project ief required.

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
